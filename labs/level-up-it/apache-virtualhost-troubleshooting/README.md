# Apache Virtual Host Troubleshooting & Remediation

This project was completed as part of the *Level Up in IT* training program.

The lab environment introduced intentional failures across multiple Apache virtual hosts. The investigation, root cause analysis, automation, and documentation were completed by me as part of the coursework.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Linux filesystem and permission validation
- Apache virtual host troubleshooting
- Safe remediation using Bash automation
- Structured problem-solving under failure conditions

## Usage

Make the script executable (if needed):

```bash
chmod +x fix_apache_virtualhosts.sh
