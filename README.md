# Networking & DevOps Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio.  
This repository showcases hands-on projects, labs, automation scripts, and documented solutions across:

- **Network Engineering**
- **Cloud Networking (AWS / Azure)**
- **DevOps & Infrastructure as Code**
- **Network Automation (Python, Bash, PowerShell)**

It serves as a living record of the problems I've solved and the technologies I work with.
